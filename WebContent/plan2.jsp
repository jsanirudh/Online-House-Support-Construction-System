			<p>This may seem like a no-brainer, but your real estate listing description should be accurate. If the house is barely 900 square feet, writing that the space is “sprawling” is dishonest. When you say a home is in “excellent condition” and there is water damage throughout the house and the back deck is rotting, a potential buyer will be turned off by seeing this on arrival. Setting unrealistic expectations helps no one..</p>
