This room contains original wallpaper including ceiling panels of small birds and orange flowers with vibrant leaves of green and yellow set upon a light blue background. The main body of the wallpaper is shades of tan and brown with light blue highlights. The fireplace is on the west wall of the room with a mantel similar to the one in the front sitting room. On the hearth are dark tiles of geometric designs with lighter colored tiles of a thistle design around the firebox. This room retains the original Brussels carpeting laid when the house was built.</p>
